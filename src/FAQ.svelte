<h2>What is this for?</h2>
<p>I do two types of reading. One, where I pick up a book and read it, and keep picking it up every day or so and continuing to read until I'm done... and then the other kind. Academic books, short story collections, or bookclub books--these I read intermittently, one chapter at a time, over a period of weeks or months (or years!). I wanted a tool to track this kind of reading. So, here it is. You can use it too, if you like.</p>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>Enter each of your in-progress books and its number of sections. (Author name is optional.) When you finish a chapter, hit the checkbox! It'll prompt you for the completion date, in case you're logging something after the fact.</p>
<p>Click "view" to toggle between books in progress and books you've finished.</p>

<h2>Why and how is this weird?</h2>
<p>All the data is stored on your local device; it doesn't live on the cloud anywhere. (This really isn't an "app" so much as a bunch of purple checkboxes.) What that means for you:</p>
<p><strong>You have to sync your data yourself.</strong> if you want to use it, say, on your phone and your laptop, you'll have to hit "save" on the first device, take the file to the second device, and "load" it. 
<p>Why did I do it this way? Because this way all I have to do is make a web page. There's no backend to worry about, no database, no authentication, no GDPR compliance, no hosting fees. It's amazingly freeing, you should try it sometime! I wanted to get this done in a weekend, and I'm really making it for myself anyway, so why not do things the easy, cheap, and fun way?</p>

<h2>What are you doing with my data?</h2>
<p>Absolutely nothing! As I said above, it never leaves your computer, unless you save it or print it. I don't see it, I don't track it, I certainly don't sell it. You can clear it all at any time by hitting the "nuke" option.</p>

<h2>There's no login. Can two people use it on the same machine?</h2>
<p>Yes, if they're willing to jump through a hoop or two. You could:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Firefox containers. (I love these, personally.) One of you claim the "personal" container and the other claim the "work" container, or some such.</li>
    <li>Use different browsers, say, one of you uses Chrome and the other uses Firefox.</li>
    <li>Save your data at the end of your session, and load from your data file at the beginning of your next one.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This experience could definitely be improved, but I can't imagine it coming up that often.)</p>

<h2>I want to leave feedback/report a bug/request features.</h2>
<p>I'd love that! Hit me up on Mastodon, log an issue on GitHub (PRs welcome), or, if you've got a feature request you really REALLY want, hit me up on ko-fi. ;)</p>
