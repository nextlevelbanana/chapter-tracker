# Chapter Tracker
This oh-so-cleverly named little app helps you keep track of textbooks, anthologies, and anything else you might be reading slowly, one chapter at a time.

## Data privacy, etc
Note that this stores all your data locally, in your browser. What does that mean, practically?
- I don't have to build or pay for a database
- I never see your data. Ever. It never leaves your computer.
- Your data is saved until you clear your browser's localStorage.
- Changing computers or browsers makes you effectively a new user. *If you use this website in a private tab, your data will be lost when you close the tab!*
